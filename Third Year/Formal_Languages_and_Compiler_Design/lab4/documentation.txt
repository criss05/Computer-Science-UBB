Finite Automata and Regular Grammars Documentation
==========================

1. Regular Grammar

1.1 Identifiers (RGID)

- Identifiers must start with a letter (@letter).
- Remaining characters can be letters, digits, or underscores.

1.2 Constants (RGConst)
- Numeric constants:
  - 0 or non-zero numbers optionally prefixed with + or -.
  - B handles sequences of digits after the first non-zero digit.
- String constants:
  - Begin and end with ".
  - May include letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
  - Q handles all characters until the closing quote (G -> ").
- The macro @symbol includes punctuation and special characters.


2. Python Script: RG -> FA Conversion

Functionality:
1. Parse RG file:
   - Reads macros (@letter, @digit, @symbol) and expands them.
   - Reads productions (S -> ...) and stores them in a dictionary.
2. Expand Symbols:
   - Expands macros, ranges (A-Z), and (space) to literal " ".
3. Build FA:
   - Converts RG into FA representation:
     - States (Q): Non-terminals + final states.
     - Alphabet (E): All terminal symbols.
     - Transitions (d): Maps state + symbol -> next state.
     - Start State (q0): First non-terminal in the grammar.
     - Final States (qf): Any state that reaches a terminal end.
4. Write FA to File:
   - Outputs FA in readable format, including states, alphabet, start state,
     final states, and transitions.
- F denotes final states automatically added for terminal-only productions.
